			<p>Master Template.</p>
			<p style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">This is important info!</p>
			<p style="color:orange;font-weight:bold;">This is a key detail.</p>
			<a href="https://granolamicro.github.io" >This is a link</a>
			<a href="https://granolamicro.neocities.org" id='desc' >This is a description link. It still works as a link.</a>

				<br/>Images must have a width tag of 128px and a border tag of 0, as well as an alt tag describing the image. If transparent, they must also have a style tag that shows a background color (default white) Additionally they can have a title tag.</a>
			<a id="desc" title="Link TItle" >This link has a title tag. Use title tags to describe things in further detail, like usernames for a social media link.</a>
		</div>
		<p>If a tag is outside the master div, it goes to the edge and that looks yucky >P</p>
		<a>Especially when it's a link!</a><br/>
		<div id="invert" >
			<p>If for some reason we want to make another div, we can!<br/>
				This will allow us to style it using IDs and classes in the stylesheet, or the style tag in the div itself.</p>
			<a>Here is an example of a link in disguise!</a><br/>
			<a id="invert" >Here is an example of a specialized link!</a><br/>
			<a id="invert" class="desc" >Here is an example of a specialized description link!</a>
			<p>For description links, we have to use classes, since a tag can't have multiple IDs.</p>
			<h1>This could also be used as a form of light mode using JS.</h1>
