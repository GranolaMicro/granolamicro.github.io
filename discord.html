			<a href="https://discord.gg/xmmdeQWtuK" >oxygen's mental hospital</a>
			<p>cool place to talk to people. originally created for the browser game manyland, the mods and rules aren't too strict, there are many roles to express yourself and be pinged, a bunch of bots for memes, music, and they have bread too.</p>
			<a href="https://discord.gg/eaF446dy4v" >Hut of the Degenerates:tm:</a>
			<p>cursed chaos left and right, this place is the wild west of discord servers. you will be bullied, make no mistake about that.</p>
			<p style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">NOTE: This server is considered NSFW, and is not intended for those who are sensitive to mature themes.</p>
			<a href="https://discord.gg/gz96UmeHuA" >❥⁎⋆Queer⋆✩⋆Cheer⋆⁎✧</a>
			<p>SFW LGBTQ+ Hangout and Gamer server - mostly Among Us and Minecraft - for ages 13-25. Allies welcome too.</p>
